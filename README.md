Description:

This ROS 2 package features two nodes for basic image data handling. The MinimalImagePublisher node periodically publishes simple image data, including dimensions and encoding. The ImageSubscriber node subscribes to this image data and logs the received information. This setup demonstrates the publisher-subscriber model in ROS 2 with the sensor_msgs/msg/Image message type, commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks within robotics.
File Structure:

your_package/
|-- src/
|   |-- minimal_image_publisher.cpp
|   |-- image_subscriber.cpp
|-- CMakeLists.txt
|-- package.xml

    src/: Contains the source files.
        minimal_image_publisher.cpp: Implements the image publisher node.
        image_subscriber.cpp: Implements the image subscriber node.
    CMakeLists.txt: CMake file for configuring the build process of the ROS 2 package.
    package.xml: Provides package metadata and dependencies.

Build Instructions:

    Place the Package: Copy your package directory into the src folder of your ROS 2 workspace.

    Compile the Package:
        Go to the root of your ROS 2 workspace.
        Run colcon build --packages-select your_package_name, replacing your_package_name with the name of your package.
        Source the setup script: source install/setup.bash.

    Run the Nodes:
        To launch the publisher node: ros2 run your_package_name minimal_image_publisher.
        In a separate terminal (after sourcing the setup script), run the subscriber node: ros2 run your_package_name image_subscriber.

    Verify Operation: Check the output in the terminal of the subscriber node to ensure it's correctly receiving and logging the image data published by the publisher node.

This package serves as an excellent introduction to ROS 2 image handling and communication, ideal for those new to the field or as a basis for more complex image-based applications in robotics.
