Description:

This ROS 2 package comprises two nodes to demonstrate basic image data handling and communication. The MinimalImagePublisher node periodically publishes synthetic image data, which includes dimensions and encoding details. On the other side, the ImageSubscriber node subscribes to this image data and logs its details. This arrangement effectively showcases the publisher-subscriber pattern in ROS 2 using the sensor_msgs/msg/Image message type, a common format in image processing and robotics applications.

    src/: Contains the source files.
        minimal_image_publisher.cpp: Implements the image publisher node.
        image_subscriber.cpp: Implements the image subscriber node.
    CMakeLists.txt: CMake file for configuring the build of the ROS 2 package.
    package.xml: Provides metadata and dependencies of the package.

Build Instructions:

    Place the Package: Copy your package directory into the src folder of your ROS 2 workspace.

    Compile the Package:
        Navigate to the root of your ROS 2 workspace.
        Execute colcon build --packages-select your_package_name to build your package. Replace your_package_name with the actual name of your package.
        Source the setup script after building: source install/setup.bash.

    Run the Nodes:
        Start the publisher node with ros2 run your_package_name minimal_image_publisher.
        In a separate terminal (after sourcing the setup script), start the subscriber node with ros2 run your_package_name image_subscriber.

    Verify Operation: Check the output in the subscriber node's terminal to confirm it is correctly receiving and logging the image data published by the publisher node.

This package provides a fundamental understanding of handling image data in ROS 2, making it suitable for beginners or as a basis for more complex image-related robotics projects. The use of mock data for demonstration emphasizes its educational and developmental utility.
